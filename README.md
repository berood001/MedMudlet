Chat windows are in adjustable containers that can be unlocked and moved around.
If something gets messed up.. it happens sometimes when moving around containers.
use "lua resetProfile()" normally fixes things.


**** Medievia Buffs N Bars ****
--------------------------------
https://github.com/berood001/MedMudlet/blob/main/MedBuffsNBars/MedBuffsNBars.mpackage
Version 1.2
- Tracks status bars to include HP/Mana/MV/BR.
- Has a buff tracker with icons to track your current buffs.
- Missing plague, curse, striking, mal
- Phan Images buff may drop while an image is still up. The game output is a bit wonky trying to track images that are destroyed.

Note:
You can sync buffs by using "SC" or "SC A". A script will clear all buffs in tracker and add them again. Useful if you disconnect while a buff falls off and you reconnect.

Future:
- Going to add alias to allow players to move the buff tracker and gauges where they want.
- Going to attempt to add timers that will highlight buffs that are fading. Somewhat difficult since different level spells have different timers. It will probably just work for heros at first.

If you see issues send Mudmail to Kronos, or ping on Discord.
